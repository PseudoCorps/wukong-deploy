  The Infochimps Platform is an end-to-end, managed solution for
  building Big Data applications.  It integrates best-of-breed
  technologies like Hadoop, Storm, Kafka, MongoDB, ElasticSearch,
  HBase, &c. and provides simple interfaces for accessing these
  powerful tools.

  Computation, analytics, scripting, &c. are all handled by Wukong
  within the platform.  Wukong is an abstract framework for defining
  computations on data.  Wukong processors and flows can run in many
  different execution contexts including:

    * locally on the command-line for testing or development purposes
    * as a Hadoop mapper or reducer for batch analytics or ETL
    * within Storm as part of a real-time data flow

  The Infochimps Platform uses the concept of a deploy pack for
  developers to develop all their processors, flows, and jobs within.
